# Json_data_parsing_ML
This is simple ML model, where it parsed data json data and implement it in model. 

### Note
Given that the file format is in .rtf format, I'm unable to directly convert it to .json. Therefore, I manually copied the data from the .rtf file and saved it as a .txt file. I have parsed the provided data and attempted to create an automated model, although it is only partially completed. In this model, I have defined some functions to assist in automation.
